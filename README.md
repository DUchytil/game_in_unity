# Overview

This game involves controlling a ball going down a path at high speeds. The object of the game is to get as far as you can without crashing into an object. There will be debris and other surprises along the way.

The game is played by using the two keys "a" and "d" for left and right movement respectively. No other controlls are required. Have fun!

I wrote this game because I enjoy C# and this project gave me an opportunity to use it. I also wanted some experience with an advanced game engine like Unity. In essence, I wanted to expand my skillsets, and I believe I've done that.
